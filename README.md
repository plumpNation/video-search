Video search page
=================

## Thanks
Forked from [jgthms.com/juketube/](http://jgthms.com/juketube/)

## Purpose

To search many video providers in one place.

## Setup

```shell
$ cp config.js.example config.js
```
Make sure to update the api keys with the correct ones.

## Requirements

You only need a valid [YouTube Data API v3 key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) to copy-paste in **config.js**. (The current one only works on my domain).
